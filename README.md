- Bug Reports: http://www.ilias.de/mantis (Choose project "ILIAS plugins" and filter by category "STACK Question Type")

This plugin is an ILIAS port of STACK, developed by Chris Sangwin. It provides a test question type
for mathematical questions that are calculated by a the Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maxima.
See the original STACK documentation at http://stack.bham.ac.uk/moodle

Additional Software Requirements
--------------------------------

* Maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net)

Maxima is a open sorce computer algebra system and part of most Linux distributions.
A version for windows is available, too. Maxima needs to be installed on the web server running
your ILIAS installation.
Either install the package from your linux distribution or download and install it from
sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/)

* GNUplot (http://www.gnuplot.info)

GNUplot is used by maxima to generate graphical plots of functions etc. It is freely available
and part of most Linux distrubutions. GNUplot needs to be installed on the web server
running your ILIAS and maxima installations.
Either install the package from your linux distribution or download and install it from
sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/)

* MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org)

MathJax is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics. It is used by the STACK plugin
to display maths in question, user input validation and feedback. It can either be linked from
cdn.mathjax.org or downloaded to your own web server. It has to be configured in ILIAS:

1. Go to Administration > Third Party Software > MathJax
2. Enable MathJax and enter the URL to MathJax (local or proposed cdn)
3. Save

First Installation of the plugin
--------------------------------

1. Copy the assStackQuestion directory to your ILIAS installation at the followin path
(create subdirectories, if neccessary):
Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions/assStackQuestion

2. Go to Administration > Plugins
3. Choose action "Update" for the assStackQuestion plugin
4. Choose action "Activate" for the assStackQuestion plugin
5. Choose action "Refresh Languages" for the assStackQuestion plugin


Configuration and test of the plugin
------------------------------------

1. Go to Administration > Plugins
2. Choose action "Configure" for the assStackQuestion plugin
3. Set the platform type and maxima version according your installation
4. Go to the tab "Health Check" and click "Do Health Check"
5. If some checks are not passed, click "Show Debugging Data" to get more information

Import of questions from moodleXML
----------------------------------

1. Create an ILIAS question pool
2. Click "Create question", choose "Stack Question" and click "Create"
3. Click "Create Question from MoodleXML"
4. Select a moodleXML package on your computer and click "Import"

Usage of STACK questions
------------------------

You can work with a STACK question like any other question in ILIAS. You can preview it in the question pool
and already try it out there. You can copy it to an ILIAS test and use it there.  A a test participant you will
normally answer a question in two steps. First you enter your answer as a formula in an input field and click "Validate"
beneath that field to check how your input is interpretet. This will give you a graphical version of you entry which may
already be simplified. If you entry can't be interpreted, you will get an error message. When you are satisfied with your
input you can evaluate your answer (in self assessment mode) or move to the next question (in an exam).

Version 2.3.0 (2016-02-29)
--------------------------
- STACK plugin can be used in ILIAS 5.0 and ILIAS 5.1 versions.
- New feedback report system:
- New ILIAS feedback tab, it works like in the other ILIAS question types and is ILIAS only, cannot be exported to Moodle. This feedback is shown when
  "feedback on fully correct answer" or "Feedback" options is activated in test settings. This feedback report appears always under the question text and
  there is two different messages, one qhen the question is correct and other if it is not fully correct. This is a normal Text and cannot contain CASText.
- Inline feedback is allowed. Feedback placeholders can be included into the question text, if done, the specific feedback for a PRT will appear within the
  question text, if not, the feedback placeholder must be in the specific feedback, a normal text area where the specific feedback will appear
  By default, specific feedback will appear under the question text. This feedback is shown when "Specific Feedback for Each Answer provided" or "Feedback" option
  are checked, then the specific feedback will be shown under the question text.
- Best solution is now displayed in the ILIAS way, like a question text filled in with the correct answer (model answer). Under this the how to solve (general feedback)
  is shown in case it exist. If there is no model answer in an input, best solution for that input will not be shown. Best solution is shown when "Show best possible answer"
  or "best solution" is checked.
- In question preview, STACK Evaluation button is not longer used, now the ILIAS check button is used to send the user answer in previews.
- The adaptation process to the new feedback system makes that all questions with no feedback placeholders will get automatically one feedback placeholder per PRT in
  the specific feedback field. Teachers can move this placeholder to the question text if they want.
    - The following bugs have been solved:
    - http://www.ilias.de/mantis/view.php?id=17984 regarding export to Moodle.
